# Task 01-03 – To-Do & Plan (CSS Structure and Theme)

## Action Plan
- Inspect current assets for any existing CSS and plan replacement/relocation into a structured `assets/css` (or `assets/js/frontend` co-located) hierarchy.
- Define token file(s) for colors, spacing, typography, radii, transitions (CSS variables).
- Add base stylesheet (reset/normalize, box-sizing, typography base) scoped to `.wiform-root` to avoid WP theme collisions.
- Create component-level placeholders for root layout, form inputs, summary, and status/message areas.
- Wire CSS import path into the Vue bundle so build emits a consolidated `wiform-frontend.css`; ensure PHP enqueues the built file (already set up).

## Requirement Refinements
- Keep all selectors namespaced (`.wiform-*`) to avoid WP/theme bleed; avoid global resets outside the mount.
- Token naming: `--wiform-color-*`, `--wiform-space-*`, `--wiform-font-*`, `--wiform-radius-*`, `--wiform-transition-*`.
- File structure proposal: `assets/css/theme/variables.css`, `assets/css/base/base.css`, `assets/css/components/*.css` (or co-located under `assets/js/frontend` and imported).
- Light/dark readiness via variable values only; no switcher yet.
- Ensure build pipeline includes CSS (via Vite import) and that PHP enqueue handle remains `wiform-frontend`.

## Suggested Order of Execution
- Audit existing CSS (if any) and decide migration/removal.
- Create token and base files; import into Vue entry.
- Scaffold component CSS modules for root, inputs, summary, status.
- Verify build outputs CSS and loads in WP (shortcode page smoke test).
- Add TODO comments for 01-05 polish where appropriate.

## Missing Context / Technical Notes
- No current CSS file enqueued existed before; now bundle CSS is emitted via Vite—confirm WP cache bust uses filemtime (already in PHP).
- Confirm whether any legacy CSS in WP theme needs to be overridden minimally (padding/margins) without global resets.
- Clarify if mobile breakpoints are required in this task or deferred to polish (default: basic responsive spacing).

Waiting for approval before starting implementation of 01-03. Will proceed once confirmed.
