# Task 01-01 – To-Do & Plan (Parent Task 01: Frontend UI)

## Action Plan
- Replace current jQuery-only calculator (`assets/js/trademark-calculator.js`) with a Vue 3 frontend mounted on shortcode output; preserve shortcode name and PHP data handoff.
- Set up a bundler (Vite or similar) to output WordPress-friendly assets (IIFE/UMD) into `assets/dist` or `assets/js/frontend`, plus a built CSS file; wire enqueue handles accordingly.
- Define a Vue entry module that mounts on every `.wiform-root`/shortcode instance and reads config from `data-wiform-config` (or `wp_localize_script`) to support multiple calculators.
- Establish component structure per spec (Root, TrademarkRow, Summary, EmailReveal, CTA) using Composition API and a single source of truth for state.
- Introduce a CSS architecture (variables, base, components) namespaced under `.wiform-*`, with tokens in `assets/css/theme` or similar; ensure enqueue path aligns with the new build.
- Plan transitions/micro-UX hooks to be implemented in later subtasks (01-04/01-05), leaving TODO markers where deeper work is deferred.

## Requirement Refinements
- Confirm target Vue version (assume Vue 3 + Composition API) and bundling format expected by WP (single JS + CSS bundle, no module loader).
- Decide final asset paths/handles (e.g., `assets/dist/wiform-frontend.js|css`) and update `register_assets()` accordingly.
- Clarify whether shortcode markup can change to a slimmer mount div (`<div class="wiform-root" data-wiform-config="...">`) or must keep current HTML structure.
- Set naming conventions for CSS variables (`--wiform-color-*`, `--wiform-space-*`) and component class prefixes to avoid theme collisions.
- Determine validation depth for MVP (clamp classes 1–100, simple email regex) and whether calculations remain pure frontend.

## Suggested Order of Execution
- Bootstrap tooling: add bundler + Vue deps, define build outputs, adjust enqueue logic.
- Implement subtask 01-02: scaffold Vue entry + component tree, mount from shortcode data, parity with current calculator logic.
- Implement subtask 01-03: add tokenized CSS structure and base styles (no heavy theming yet).
- Implement subtask 01-04: wire reactive behaviour/state machine, validation, CTA/email reveal.
- Implement subtask 01-05: apply visual polish and micro-UX transitions using tokens.
- Implement subtask 01-06: QA/refactor pass, remove dead legacy assets, document decisions.

## Missing Context / Technical Notes
- `docs/tasks/01-02_add-vue.md` is empty; need specs for Vue architecture (will infer from parent/spec doc unless provided).
- CSS file enqueued in PHP (`assets/css/trademark-calculator.css`) does not exist; enqueue paths will need to change once build outputs are defined.
- No build tooling or Vue deps in `package.json` (only `@wordpress/env`); adding dependencies/tooling is required.
- Current frontend markup and logic are jQuery-based and not namespaced for components; confirm how much HTML can be replaced vs. minimally adapted for Vue mounting.
- Need confirmation of WordPress/PHP version targets and whether multiple calculator instances per page must be supported.

Waiting for approval before starting implementation. If approved, will begin with subtask 01-02 (Vue scaffold + build setup).
